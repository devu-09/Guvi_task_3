            <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. 
                This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed 
                or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. 
                This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your
                 understanding of what is possible.</p>

                  <h2>Features of JavaScript</h2>
                  <p>There are following features of JavaScript:</p>
                  <ol>
                      <li>All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.</li>
                      <li>JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.</li>
                      <li>JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).</li>
                      <li>JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.</li>
                      <li>It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.</li>
                      <li>It is a case-sensitive language.</li>
                      <li>JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.</li>
                      <li>It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.</li>
                  </ol>

              </div>
              <div>
                  <p>In 1993, Mosaic, the first popular web browser, came into existence. In the year 1994,
                       Netscape was founded by Marc Andreessen. He realized that the web needed to become
                        more dynamic. Thus, a 'glue language' was believed to be provided to HTML to make web
                         designing easy for designers and part-time programmers. Consequently, in 1995, the company
                          recruited Brendan Eich intending to implement and embed Scheme programming language to the 
                          browser. But, before Brendan could start, the company merged with Sun Microsystems for adding
                           Java into its Navigator so that it could compete with Microsoft over the web technologies and 
                           platforms. Now, two languages were there: Java and the scripting language. Further, Netscape
                            decided to give a similar name to the scripting language as Java's. It led to 'Javascript'. 
                            Finally, in May 1995, Marc Andreessen coined the first code of Javascript named 'Mocha'.
                             Later, the marketing team replaced the name with 'LiveScript'. But, due to trademark reasons 
                             and certain other reasons, in December 1995, the language was finally renamed to 'JavaScript'.
                              From then, JavaScript came into existence.</p>

                    <p>JavaScript is used to create interactive websites. It is mainly used for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Client-side validation,</li>
                        <li>Dynamic drop-down menus,</li>
                        <li>Displaying date and time,</li>
                        <li>Displaying pop-up windows and dialog boxes (like an alert dialog box, confirm dialog box and prompt dialog box),</li>
                        <li>Displaying clocks etc.</li>
